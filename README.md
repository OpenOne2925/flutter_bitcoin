## ðŸŽ¯ Why Shared Haven?

Shared Haven aims to be more than just a wallet. Think of it as a **co-funding / community wallet** where friends, roommates, or small groups can transparently manage a shared pot or expense pool.

## ðŸ§± Architecture & Modules

Hereâ€™s a rough breakdown of how things are organized:

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **lib/** | Core Dart / Flutter code |
| **lib/models** | Models / data classes |
| **lib/services** | Abstractions for API / storage / business logic |
| **lib/ui / widgets** | Reusable UI components |
| **assets/** | Static assets (icons, images, translations) |
| **android / ios / web** | Platform-specific configs |

We follow **separation of concerns**, **clean architecture**, and aim for testability where possible.
